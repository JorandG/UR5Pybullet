# UR5Pybullet
This project aims to control a UR5 using reinforcement learning. This project aims to control a UR5 using reinforcement learning. It allows to have an autonomous robot that learns from interaction with its environment. The simulation engine used is Pybullet which easy to use and open sourced. 
A first version with Q-Learning is better to use if you start in machine learning. Then the Deep-Q-Learning with a neural network can be used. Different tasks can be set up with OpenAi Gym. A reach task is detailed, the end effector has to reach a target with the minimum number of steps.
